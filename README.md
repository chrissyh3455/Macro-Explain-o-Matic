Macro-Explain-o-Matic
=====================

This is all the source and tools for Fitzcairn's Macro Explain-o-matic (www.macroexplain.com).  I am choosing to release all the source for this project in the hope that someone will find it useful.

A couple things to note about this code:

1. It was intended as an experiment to see how Google App Engine performed (and at the time it was written, the answer was "poorly!" for a number of reasons).  The code is structured entirely around GAE's unique persistence model.
2. This is my first foray into writing a parse tree + interpreter.  You have been warned. :)
3. I'm also including all of the JS code I wrote to empower sites to take advantage of my API to do explain macros.

For a good intro to WoW's macro language, please see: http://www.wowwiki.com/Making_a_macro.  I owe much to Cogwheel, the author of these (and many other) articles.

Good luck, and feel free to ping me with questions.
