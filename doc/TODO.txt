- FOR ADDON:
  o users copy and paste all of macros into web form and get
response which is parsed by addon
  o each addon is updateable individually
  o users will see interpretations on mouseover in macro frame
  o also on mouseover on macro bar
  o users can share macro links to friends with the addon, which
  will offer copy-to-maro book.
  o links will also offer explanations when clicked.

  will need special macro URL.


- How about making parameters tags automatically?
  o If found by wowhead, add as tag.


!!!- Add a feedback widget on each line for feedback for incorrect macros!!

  Should this be per-line?  Or per explanation?  Gut says
per-line--it'd be more useful that way.






- Add a NEWS section that replaces the blog!!
  o Should go on front page.


- Catch repeated conditions with reordered options.



-- ADD A WHITELIST OF SPELLS TO SCANNER TO ENSURE THE RIGHT ONE IS
CHOSEN:

/cast Divine Illumination

The tooltip on your website links to the Paladin Tier 10 bonus
(http://www.wowhead.com/spell=71166) instead of the actual spell
(http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31842).

-- Add empty rank (like "Spell()") support to spell data.

-- Fix GCD info from my SoE thread--add a whitelist for GCDs to data
creation process!

-- Add unit tests for front-page rendering routines.




- - - DONE, BUT NOT DEPLOYED - - -


- Refactor javascript windowing library to use for TTs and
errors/warnings/feedback instead of CSS crap.







- - - DEPLOYED - - -


XX - SPACING WRONG ON RENDERERD MACRO COMMANDS -- WHY?????  FIX!!!


XX - MUST DO: time to add a static files domain and get rid of
  having all my static files served out of appengine.
  After all, I pay for hosting for a reason!

XX - Tooltip library.

XX - Added Google analytics



XX -- Repeated options are not caught correctly.

Example:

/cast [mod:alt, combat, mod:alt] Spell

Should remove the last mod:alt seen.


XX --BUG:

/tar [nodead] Val
/cast Charge

Causes an error!


XX -- OPTION KEYS DEFINED IN THE INTERFACE ARE NOT 
RECOGNIZED CORRECTLY!


Example:
 /cast [mod:FOCUSCAST] SPELL

Casts SPELL on the focus!!

Q: /cast [mod:FOCUSCAST, target=player] SPELL
Does it work on the focus or on the player? 

A: Works on the player.  Honors target= command over mod.


XX-- Bug with targetexact:

/targetexact target-pet

Should NOT parse as parameter as a target.



XX-- Targeting bug:

Macro: /cast [target=Shadow-target]Cyclone
Explanation: Cast Cyclone on Shadow-'s currently targeted unit

Macro: /cast [ target = Shadowtarget ] Cyclone
Explanation: Cast Cyclone on Shadow's currently targeted unit

/cast [target=Donuts-target] Mark of the Wild
/cast [target=Donutstarget] Mark of the Wild (doesn't work)


It used to be you did "<name><unit>" but that got changed a while ago
as it was causing issues, it's now "<name>-<unit>" and it only works
for players in your group (or yourself). (verified)


-
Additionally, you can optionally put the dash in between any two
units. This should be accounted for when displaying the results to the
user.

target-target results in "target-'s target".  (verified)




XX -- UI issues:

@ http://www.macroexplain.com/m8b 

at the bottom where you give the option to copy the macro, it should
be the same box functionally as what people use to type macros in when
they visit the site. Otherwise you end up with <BR> spam


XX -- Handle macro line commenting

#show Chain Lightning

--/use 13
/use 14
/cast Elemental Mastery
/cast Chain Lightning


XX -- BUG:

#showtooltip [btn:2]Frostbolt;Fireball
/cast Frostbolt
/cast Fireball

A macro doesn't know what icon/spell to display until it is clicked if
[button:x] or [btn:x] are used as the modifiers for the #show /
#showtooltip line. By then, you've already triggered the macro, and
it's pointless.


Make these into unit tests:

XXX --- ADD COLUMN SORT TO SEARCH RESULTS!!


XX - BUG: Try this:

  #showtooltip [mod] 0 16; 17
  /equipslot 17 0 16

  This needs fixing: with the # commands, you can use a spell name, item
  name, item id (item:12345), inventory slot, or bag and slot numbers.

XX - BUG: some conditions are meaningless and should be checked for.
  Essentially, anytime you target yourself, you better know what you're doing.
  For example:
    [target=player,exists,help] -- that is ALWAYS going true!
    [target=player,harm,dead]   -- that is ALWAYS going to be false!
  SOLUTION: add a warning anytime the player uses "target=player" or "@player"

XX - Add "vehicleui" and "unithasvehicleui" conditionals. (DONE)

XX - Add @target shorthand for target=XXX! 

XX -- NOTE FROM SITE: (now fixed thanks to mmo-champion!)

Just a note, on Silencing Shot (Marksman Hunters
http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=34490) the marco-matic states that it
triggers a global cooldown which from my understanding it
doesn't. Other than that, thanks for the very usefull tool!



BUGS TO FIX:
------------

-- Reload item data using the extra parameter I added to store items
by id as well as by name!

-- Keep going through saved macros, look at each one.

-- Spell data bugs:
  o If wowhead has a level, prefer that
  o "Used by" isn't always bad!  Some valid pet spells are shared with
    NPCs.  Example:
    http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=6358#comments

- Add '/in' command.
http://www.macroexplain.com/m9

-- Add better error correction!!!
  o Good example of need: incorrect equipslot commands (no slot, slot
in wrong place, etc).

-- Move to an image server, set up subdomain


FROM RHAL:

Just a couple thoughts.

 [X]   Where you have if / else moments, I prefer to use the word "if <this>
then:" and "otherwise:" instead of actually saying "else" in your
explanation. It's really just a personal opinion about aesthetics. It
removes some of the nerdiness that comes with certain phrases. (I
still get a giggle out of people saying fsck instead of fuck)

 [ ]   I would add some error handling for advanced macros. There's some out
there that don't use /castsequence spell1, spell2, spell3, etc, they
can either exclude the first or last spell / item name and get some
different effects if I remember right. I've got to hit the sack in a
moment or I would double check what exactly it does in that situation
myself.

 [X]   Thought about WoWHead integration? Like displaying an overlay when
"/use item:34483" appears to show http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34483
instead of the text "item:34483".
    -- NEED TO ADD TESTS FOR THIS.
    -- FOR SOME REASON /CAST ITEM:XXX MACROS ARE WORKING


 [ ]   Add support for the Super Duper Macro addon. As in, include an option
to remove the total characters limit, and enforce a 1023 character
line limit.

 [ ]   You might even be able to take it a step further and try to work with
the developer of SDM to let them use your URLs for macro
sharing/importing/exporting if you haven't already.

 [ ]   All in all thought, it's rather nice actually. I get the feeling
you'll get more traffic through macros being shared in game than you
would the explanations, but that's probably heavily biased from
knowing most things about macros.

PS: Yes I remember you. :P 












---------------

All fixed:

IS %t  SUPPOSED TO WORK in this????  YES IT DOES.

Works in /r /reply too--all the chats.

- /tell and /t are not recognized correctly.

   /tell %t
Does not work.  "%t" is not currently playing.  Therefore require
A-Za-z for parameter!

  /tell <stuff>
Does not work.  Requires a target unit.  Therefore first word must be
te target.


- /r and /reply
Takes NO target--everything is put into the reply.


- Serious bugs overall with how emotes are handled.  Should be able to
take a unit:

    /emote TARGET
 Emotes at the TARGET, requires A-Za-z

    /emote %t
 Emotes at the TARGET

    /emote TARGET <anything else>
 Emotes ignoring everything, including TARGET

No conditions used in a unit.


DONE:

http://www.macroexplain.com/m4
- Get rid of spells with "Used by" in the data

http://www.macroexplain.com/m5
- Get rid of spells with "Triggered by" in the data







BUG REPORTS:
----------------------------------------

FROM THREAD:

In keeping with the multiple line interpretation thing, I tried this one.

/equipslot 18 Nesingwary 4000
/equipslot 0 Blackflight Arrow

Equips a gun to the ranged slot, and arrows to the ammo slot.
Technically correct, but perhaps a warning that the gun won't work
with that type of ammo would be incredibly useful, in case people
change their macros without really looking




FROM RELEASE BLOG:
Not sure if this is the right place for this comment. You have a bug
with Rune Strike. It is a "Next Melee" based attack, but I'm thinking
your database has it stored as an instant attack? The macro parser
thinks that this ability is causing the GCD, though it should not
actually cause it.


[ FIXED ]
-- dude, have the current patch in two places in the save box!!  Get
rid of one!


(FROM WOW.COM)

---hmmmmm do this!


It looks really frackin cool. I might recommend, for the share
feature, presetermining which classes it would be useful for based on
spells cast. For example, if the parser sees "/cast Prayer of
Mending", that's only going to be useful for priests, whereas right
now it allows the user to input any class.



----------------------------------------

(FROM FORUM THREAD)

[ FIXED ]

Do error checking for items when used with slot ids.  right now can
equip sheilds as neck (Hyperious)

o I have this data already.  Use it, spring an error when the slotid
doesn't match.


---

Hello =) I'm not from SoE, but I read about your site on wowinsider
and it's really, really cool. ^^ I saw this thread and immediately
started testing my more complex macros in the hope that I'd have an
excuse to post here. xD

A couple of things:

The interpreter does not recognize the different types of Polymorphs
as spells currently (ie, Polymorph(Pig) and Polymorph(Rabbit) ).

The interpreter does not recognize the secondary conditional Raid in
the conditional [group:raid] or [nogroup:raid].

Slow Fall is interpreted as only castable on the player; though that's
probably be a WoWhead spell issue.

%t isn't recognized as "the name of your current target" currently, in
case you want to implement that functionality some day =)

That's all I could find in a half an hour. Thank you so much for
making this awesome tool, now I can fiddle with macros on computers
that don't have WoW. ^^ I look forward to the implementation of Lua
comprehension! 


----------------------------------------

(FROM BLOG)

[ FIXED, targeting is now correct ]

http://www.macroexplain.com/m7

line #2's explanation reads: If your pet's currently targeted unit
does not exist then: Order your pet to attack your pet's currently
targeted unit.

It should read: If your pet's currently targeted unit does not exist
then: Order your pet to attack your target.

The subject of the action was wrongly explained.

---

[ FIXED, now recognizes equipset and usetalents ]

Nice site, however, it doesn't recognize /equipset and /usetalents.

[ TODO: BETTER SCRAPING FROM WOWHEAD ]


I just uploaded a macro, but the explanation was wrong when it came to
the following line:

/cast [target=focus,exists,nodead,noharm,nomodifier] Earth Shield; [target=target,modifier] Earth Shield

The explanation correctly identified everything until it came to the
actual cast target. In both cases, your explain-o-matic states that it
will cast Earth Shield on yourself. However, this macro in use will
cast on the focus target (if it exists, is not dead, and is not an
enemy if no modifier is held), or it will cast on the current target
(if a modifier is held). If Auto Self Cast is enabled and if the
current target is an enemy, it will cast on the caster if a modifier
is held down, but that is a bonus side effect.

---

[ TODO: BETTER ERROR CORRECTION ]

The macro translation engine crashes when given the following expression
/cast [target=focus target=target]
It cannot handle two target= statements within the same brackets.

---

[ TODO: BETTER SCRAPING FROM WOWHEAD ]

I found an error in the explanation of this macro:

http://www.macroexplain.com/m37

When the pet is Succubus, it should read that Seduction is cast on
taget focus. Instead of this it shows up as "Cast Seduction on
yourself".

When the pet is felhunter, the macro has been parsed correctly.

-------------------------------------------------






 o When we don't recognize the button in /click, put up a warning.


 o Can we combine gcd and show_gcd somehow in Verb objects?


 o Need MUCH better error correction.


 o Fix the macro-length reporting problems.  Doing weird shit.


 o Support item ids as parameters!






- OTHER TO-DOS
 -- Add colored fonts based on macro token type!
 -- NEW FAVICON!!!!!
 -- ADD AN "OUT OF QUOTA" HANDLER?
